meetup-series
    designates a group of meetups
    assumed to share a schedule
        usually also a location but those can change or be reused
    - edge case: meetup at a different spot
    - border case: meetup alternating spots
 
topic
    designates a recurring topic
        (may be reused in different groups)
    has a name and a body (description)
        body may have several formats
            plain/full, destination, any others?

unique meetup
    unshared time like day of the month/year
    ?combined params like title (uses series/topic/unique time)

plain/full
    binary, should this be rich text or not
        bools munged to strings in the datastore but this is handled invisibly
    entirely for output formats

destination
    facebook, discord, LW, email, text
    affects format for output, mostly title/body
    closely tied to where it's being posted

location
    lat/long (mostly for LW), street address, entry instructions
    separate table for reusability
        input table stores a location name, used as primary key for loc table
