lookup by multiple keys is not suited for JSON

presumably use a NoSQL, lightest-weight possible

or maybe SQLite?
SQLite is probably not tolerant of incomplete lookups

either one is more difficult to add to for other users
- do I care about other users?
- probably not, and I can create a setup tool if that changes
(may create that for myself anyway)


alternatively store names in a DB and then grab those files
...no that seems like a terrible idea
