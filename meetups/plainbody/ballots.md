This week, [as requested in ACX](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/ballots-everywhere-times-and-places), we'll be taking a look at election ballots, mostly for local races, and investigating and discussing them. Our general conclusions will be [gathered in this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/185RsOSxQDT0Oyf1SuqcQEW3BaLGnqQekZeHkx04fDL8/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.p67l54j9vb9s), and also posted to LessWrong, the email list, and the local Discord, as well as sent to Scott.
