We meet every ${day_of_week} in ${city} at ${start_time}, with a rotating variety of topics but don’t generally start the meetup topic until ${start_time_plus_30m} to accommodate stragglers. Often there is a food delivery order that goes out before we start the meetup topic.

The ${name} meetup is intended as a fun, low-key social space with some structured interaction, where new and non-new community members can mingle and have interesting conversations.
Everyone is welcome, and RSVPs are never required.

We explicitly encourage people to split off from the main conversation or diverge from the topic if that would be more fun for them (moving side conversations into a separate part of the space if appropriate). Meetup topics are here as a tool to facilitate fun interaction, and we certainly don’t
want them to inhibit it.
