The mission of the ${name} LessWrong meetup is to provide a fun, low-key social space with
some structured interaction, where new and non-new community members can mingle and have interesting
conversations. Everyone is welcome. Yes, that includes you, if you're reading this. We meet at
${start-time}, but the official topic doesn't start until ${start-time-plus-30m} to accommodate
stragglers, and even later arrivals are also welcome. RSVPs are never required.

This week's topic is ${body}
