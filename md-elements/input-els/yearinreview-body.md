We'll spend some time looking at our past year and asking questions of ourselves. What did you mean your priorities to be, last year, and what did it look like they were? What did you start doing, and stop doing, and do you endorse those choices? If you were to 80/20 the year, what was the 20% and what was the 80%? Then we'll talk some about our answers and any questions they raise.
