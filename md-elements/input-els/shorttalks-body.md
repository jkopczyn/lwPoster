We'll be meeting to give and listen to very short talks!

We'll do 7-minute lightning talks with 3 additional minutes allowed for questions. A talk doesn't have to be formal, planned, or even something that you'd expect someone to Give A Talk About; it can be as simple as telling the group about something you find interesting or cool. In the past, we've had people talk about topics like: how complicated the process of organizing fresh food for airplane flights is, their experience volunteering for a local political campaign, a video game they were designing and writing, and many others.

We don't expect any sort of preparation or practice for these kinds of talks. They're very casual and the expectations are low. If your talk isn't great, it's okay because we'll just move on to another one in a few minutes. If it helps, think of it this way: you're just being given the conversational floor for a few minutes, in a slightly more organized way than usual.
