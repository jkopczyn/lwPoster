Deep Questions: We'll break into pairs, read an open-ended question, and spend a few minutes
listening to each other's answers. Then we'll pair with other people and new questions a few more
times.

Example questions:

- What in life gets you really excited?
- What's something that's worth about as much to you as one of your pinky fingers?
- What was the best phase of your life?

Note: The questions are (arguably) deep, but your answers don't need to be. There's no
expectation that participants will share any more than they're comfortable with.
